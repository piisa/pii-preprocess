MORUS RUBRA
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Species of tree

MORUS RUBRA, commonly known as the RED MULBERRY, is a species of
mulberry native to eastern and central North America. It is found from
Ontario, Minnesota, and Vermont south to southern Florida, and west as
far as southeastern South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and central Texas.
There have been reports of isolated populations (very likely
naturalized) in New Mexico, Idaho, and British Columbia. ([2])

Common in the United States, it is listed as an endangered species in
Canada,([3][4]) and is susceptible to hybridization with the invasive
white mulberry (M. alba), introduced from Asia. ([5])

Description

Red mulberry is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, growing to 10–15
metres (35–50 feet) tall, rarely 21 m (70 ft), with a trunk up to 50
centimetres (20 inches) in diameter. It can live up to 125 years. ([6])

The leaves are alternate, 7–18 cm (2+3⁄4 – 7 in) long (rarely to 36 cm
or 14+1⁄4 in) and 8–12 cm (3+1⁄4 – 4+3⁄4 in) broad (about twice as big as the
white mulberry's leaves), ([3]) simple, broadly cordate, with a shallow notch
at the base, typically unlobed on mature trees although often with 2–3 lobes,
particularly on young trees, and with a finely serrated margin. ([3])
Unlike the leaves of white mulberry (M. alba) which have a lustrous
upper surface, the red mulberry leaf upper surface is noticeably rough,
similar in texture to fine sandpaper, and the underside is densely
covered with soft hairs. ([7][8]) The leaf petiole exudes milky sap when
severed. ([9]) The leaves turn yellow in autumn.

The flowers are relatively inconspicuous: small, yellowish green or
reddish green and opening as leaves emerge. Male and female flowers are
usually on separate trees although they may occur on the same tree.

The fruit is a compound cluster of several small achenes surrounded by a
fleshy calyx, similar in appearance to a blackberry, 2–3 cm
(3⁄4 – 1+1⁄4 in) long. It is initially pale green, ripening to red or dark
purple. ([3])


Ecology

Red mulberry is hardy to subzero temperatures, relatively hardy to
drought, pollution, and poor soil, though the white mulberry is
hardier. ([10])

The berries are widely sought after by birds in spring and early summer
in North America; as many as 31 species of birds have been recorded
visiting a fruiting tree in Arkansas. ([11])


Uses

The berries are edible and sweet. ([12]) The wood may be dried and used
for smoking meats with a flavor that is mild and sweet.

Some Native American tribes used an infusion of the bark as a laxative
or purgative. Infusions of the root were used to treat weakness and
urinary ailments. The sap was applied to the skin to treat
ringworm. ([3]) Choctaw people wove clothing from the inner bark of
young M. rubra and similar shoots. ([13])

The first English colonists to explore eastern Virginia in 1607
mentioned the abundance of both mulberry trees and their fruit, which
was eaten (sometimes boiled) by the native Powhatan tribes. Today,
mulberries are eaten raw, used in the fillings of pastries, and
fermented into wine.
